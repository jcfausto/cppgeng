# A 3D Game Engine using SDL2 and C++

This is a hobby project. I'm using C++11, SDL2, VisualStudio Code, CMake, Make and MinGW on Windows. 

If you want to use this project, take a look into the CMakeList.txt and make sure to change it or create the required env variables. 

Also, you'll need to have SDL2 properly installed on your system. 

I'll improve this doc later.
